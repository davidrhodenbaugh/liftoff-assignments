## Submission Instructions

### Overview
One Feed is a social media website that aims to condense and simplify the annoyance and clutter of modern day social media. We aim to do this by creating a website that will track users' social media accounts and combine them into 'one feed' on a single website page. The idea came from being overwhelmed by the continuous emergence of social media platforms that are essentially the same.
